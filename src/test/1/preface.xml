    <title>What is FreeMarker?</title>

    <para>FreeMarker is a <emphasis>template engine</emphasis>: a generic
    tool to generate text output (anything from HTML to autogenerated source
    code) based on templates. It's a Java package, a class library for Java
    programmers. It's not an application for end-users in itself, but
    something that programmers can embed into their products.</para>

    <para>FreeMarker is designed to be practical for the generation of
    <emphasis>HTML Web pages</emphasis>, particularly by servlet-based
    applications following the <link linkend="gloss.MVC">MVC (Model View
    Controller) pattern</link>. The idea behind using the MVC pattern for
    dynamic Web pages is that you separate the designers (HTML authors) from
    the programmers. Everybody works on what they are good at. Designers can
    change the appearance of a page without programmers having to change or
    recompile code, because the application logic (Java programs) and page
    design (FreeMarker templates) are separated. Templates do not become
    polluted with complex program fragments. This separation is useful even
    for projects where the programmer and the HTML page author is the same
    person, since it helps to keep the application clear and easily
    maintainable.</para>

    <para>Although FreeMarker has some programming capabilities, it is
    <emphasis>not</emphasis> a full-blown programming language like PHP.
    Instead, Java programs prepare the data to be displayed (like issue SQL
    queries), and FreeMarker just generates textual pages that display the
    prepared data using templates.</para>

    <para>FreeMarker is <emphasis>not</emphasis> a Web application
    framework. It is suitable as a component in a Web application framework,
    but the FreeMarker engine itself knows nothing about HTTP or servlets.
    It simply generates text. As such, it is perfectly usable in non-web
    application environments as well. Note, however, that we provide
    out-of-the-box solutions for using FreeMarker as the view component of
    Model 2 frameworks such as Struts.</para>
