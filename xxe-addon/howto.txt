XMLmind XML Editor addon for Docgen
===================================

This addon customizes the bundled DocBook 5 configuration so that it
will be better for editing documentations conforming to the Docgen
conventions. The customization will only affect the documents that has
conformance="docgen" in their root element, not all DocBook documents.

Requires at least XXE 9.5.0. Last tested on 9.5.0.


How to install
--------------

Just copy the docbook-for-freemarker directory into "addon"
subdirectory of your XXE user preferences directory, which is
(usually):

On UNIX:
  $HOME/.xxe/addon

On Windows 7-10:
  c:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\XMLmind\XMLEditor<V>\addon
  (replace %USERNAME% with your user name that you see in the Windows start menu,
  <V> with the XEE major version.)
  
On Windows XP:
  C:\Documents and Settings\%USERNAME%\Application Data\XMLmind\XMLeditor<V>\addon

Then restart XXE if it was running. From now on all DocBook 5 XML-s
whose root element has a conformance="docgen" attribute will be opened
with this addon. Other DocBook documents are not affected.


How to update the addon
-----------------------

Repeat the installation procedure (overwrite the files), then you may have
to clear the Quick Start cache through the XXE menu:
"Options" -> "Preferences" -> "Advanced" -> "Cached data".
